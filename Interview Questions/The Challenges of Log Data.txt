#### Question 3

  For my project, I worked primarily with log data with I inspected after having 
everything up and going to investigate the traffic on my server. I wanted to investigate any 
suspicious traffic on my server. In this case, it was primarily RPM downloads being they 
were the most suspicious.  The overall data I collected for the 7-day investigation was just 
over 76.4 kb. 

	I was primarily filtering through data spikes, to search for anything out of the ordinary. 
Once I limited those encounters I then filtered through on Kibana to find the source of the 
anomalies, in this instance, it was RPM files. So therefore that’s what I investigated. Whats 
nice about my use of the service Kibana is that I wasn’t stuck reading large amounts of data 
but instead was able to easily filter through and find what I was looking for. Once I found the 
activity in question via Metricbeat, I was then able to use the system logs collected by 
filebeat to review the incident.

The charts I used where heatlamps, maps, bph, and the filter options as well as the syslogs ability
 once I defined my search.
